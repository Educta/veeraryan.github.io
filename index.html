<p style="color: white; font-size: 30px"> Hello.</p>
Life is hard and pretty sucky sometimes. You have to see your father ill and weak, your mother teary-eyed and yourself helpless. <br>
There's a high chance that my dad is contaminated with the deadly coronavirus. If he is, then so is everyone at our place.
My mom, my brother and me too. Now like I mentioned above, the "deadly" coronavirus is merciless.
So there's a chance I might not survive this and there's a chance that I do. Just in case the former prevails, I want this to be a public legacy.
With the little new learnt knowledge of HTML and CSS, I'm trying out a small death blog. Not gonna share this with anyone
right now but let's hope someone will find it someday and if not, I'll share it myself. If I do survive it, well then, this won't even ever matter
and I might never tell anyone about this or use it in just another pandemic story when all of this is over. <br>
I'm not gonna pay for the domain, that'd be silly. I'll probably use some free ones available online. it's 6th August, 18:07 right now.
I'll write the next one soon and hopefully put this on the internet. <br>See you soon.

  Is it really just paranoia?

I'm paranoid. That's what my girlfriend tells me and yeah, I believe her. My problem started back in my first relationship.
My ex had a lot of male friends and one of them was my close friend who also had a crush on her. I was naturally a little insecure
when they got too close to each other; they used to sit together and when she wasn't talking to me it seemed like it was only
him she could confide her emotions in. I felt sad and helpless up until hell broke loose and  I broke up with her.
I had lost my feelings for her and then few months later, she was in a relationship with the same guy.
Now, not that I bother cause I was way past over her but that left a scar in the back of my head that would haunt me in my future
for I don't know how long. <br><br>
Well, part of it has begun and I can't explain why I can't trust my girlfriend with all the guys she's friends with. And, again,
one of them is my best friend... who, by the way, also happens to have a major crush on her. Things get pretty awkward and
I even confronted them about my insecurity and they helped quite a bit but here's the thing... You don't choose who you fall for and that's what I'm afraid of.
I don't have any female friends. Not because she asked me not to, but because I know it's not my choice who I'll fall for.
Now it's obviously on me to choose to act upon my feelings which I won't, but I would never wanna jeopardize what I have.
Part of the reasons I suck at being okay with her male friends is that I kinda expected the same for myself. I'm being unfair here.
I don't expect others to do the same to me when I do them wrong but I want them to help me when I help them. I admit this makes me a dick (or human, maybe).
<br><br> I'm now in class 11th and this is a crucial time for me. Such emotions aren't what I need right now.
But, there isn't something I could do, nothing that I know of. We're slowly fading. We don't have much to talk about.
We say it's because we don't have much going on in our life and I really hope that's the reason because I really don't wanna lose her.
We've changed a lot. I don't get the same vibes from her. I can't prove it but she seems kinda uninterested in me now. Now this
could be just me overthinking because she assures me of her love for me often. I wanna believe her because I love her but those vibes and my thoughts don't help.
It's also true that when you get attention from more than one place, you take the closest one for granted. <br><br>
Now if you tell me "love is all about your partner's happiness but you're making it all about yourself," well, there was a time before this phase,
and the love I'm used to isn't this. I'd be happy for her happiness but wouldn't it hurt to see her with someone else?
Now if you say, "You don't trust her," well, I really don't know what I feel about that and that makes me feel dead-guilty.
There are two parts within me and one of them trusts her the most but the other one keeps reminding me of my past. It's unfair to her
and I don't feel good about it either. <br><br>Now I sometimes ask myself, "Bro, you blamed it on paranoia alright, but, I mean, you sure?"
Now this is a little paradoxical because I'm paranoid about my paranoia. This endless feedback loop from hell will rot me to the tip of my heart.
I hate myself sometimes.<br>
See you soon.
